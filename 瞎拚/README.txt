Just a puzzle game.

Click the blocks beside empty space, it would be moved to there, try to finish the puzzle after doing some moves.

Click "難度" button to choose start state difficulty.

Click "洗牌" button to reset the puzzle area.

Click ("選擇檔案") or (paste a url to "圖片網址" and click "取得網址圖片") to import a img you want to build into a puzzle. Or it would use default img.


Images are from internet, I don't own anyone of them.
